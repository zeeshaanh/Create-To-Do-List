        <p>This is a project I created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript; I decided to create a to do list as it requires many different and more advanced features of JavaScript;
            previously, I have had some experience with JavaScript with for loops and if/else statements. I also have come across functions, but my understanding wasn't as strong as I 
            would have liked. With this to do list I have had to use functions and now feel I have a good level understanding of them; along with functions, I have been introduced to
            objects and 'this' keyword. I understand the syntax of objects and how you can access them or a specific property within the object. I also have a basic understanding of how to manipulate the DOM using JavaScript and how you can create elements in JavaScript
            which the user can access. </p>
        <br /> 
        <p>To use this to do list; you can type in what you like and click add and it will display on the screen; as for the change list item and toggle completed; they require numbers.
            In JavaScript, the first item starts at 0, so if you would like to change the first item or toggle the first item; you would need to select 0. This is a problem
            I encountered and I lack the knowledge of how to fix it. This is where I hope to gain an apprenticeship as I am eager to learn more about Software Development and improve upon my skills.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>I have also had more experience with HTML as I am now able to create buttons which is something I was unaware of previously. Overall, I feel this project has been very
            beneficial for myself as I have not only strengthened my JavaScript and HTML skills; but also my development skills as a whole; this is because I came across different
            problems when coding and sometimes the solution would be easy to find, while others it would take longer. I am eager to continue to self-learn and continue developing
            more projects in the hope of gaining an Software Development Apprenticeship.
